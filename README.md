# ALU_16_bit
This repository contains a 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) written in Verilog. The ALU supports arithmetic, logic, comparison, and shift operations based on a 4-bit control input. It provides operation-specific flags to indicate the type of executed instruction and a carry flag for arithmetic operations.
